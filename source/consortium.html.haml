  %h2.page-title Come join us
  %p The IIT Institute of Design (ID) is inviting companies and other organizations to become members of its <strong>d:Learn</strong> Consortium.  <strong>d:Learn</strong> is a set of projects that explore how to make learning more effective, whether this is in schools, corporate training, associations, or personal interests.  Just like design can transform products, information, environments and services, design can bring surprising improvements to how people learn.  The core design principles: <strong>being user-centered; balancing technology, economics and user desires, reframing problems; exploring  multiple options, and thinking in systems</strong> can help learning in the ways it has helped other daily life activities.

  %h2.page-title Henry Ford learning in a Twitter world
  %p The institutions dedicated to teaching and learning have not changed very much in the last century.   Indeed, if Henry Ford returned in a time machine today, it is likely the only organizations he would be recognize are schools. Schools employ the same models as his River Rouge factory: bring material in at one end, focus on prescribed standards, test at the end of the process to ensure standards are met.  These systems worked well when life daily life and work was not information intensive and and was not constantly changing.

  %h2.page-title Complexity
  %p How humans work, travel, shop, manage family life, play, and learn have gone through dramatic changes.  The support systems that help people negotiate these activities of daily life have all been been re-designed to be more <strong>open, responsive, efficient, and conscious</strong> of the end user.
  %p Consider mobile and remote work and how often people change jobs. Consider the phenomena of Zipcar, frequent flier miles, express lanes for cars with two or more people, and privatized space travel.  Consider the complexity of the family calendar and complex logistics of managing after school and weekend activities. Consider games, social media and iTunes.
  %p All would be unrecognizable to Mr. Ford until he visited classrooms and looked at learning environments and materials whether they are intended to teach kids or adults.

  %h2.page-title Our Three Core Principles

  %h3 1. <strong>Learner centered</strong>
  %p New abilities are gained when related to the learners goals, interests and current abilities.

  %h3 2. <strong>Integrated with the rest of life</strong>
  %p Schools and training programs should not be separate from other activities of the learner.  Public schools and organizational training should be related to the rest the world, whether is hobbies or work.

  %h3 3. <strong>Innovation from the edge</strong>
  %p Those working in this area should expect innovations to come from the outside of traditional learning research centers.
